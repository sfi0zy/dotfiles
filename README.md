# Dotfiles

Simple configuration files for front-end developer.

*This is not a completed auto-configuration that makes magic changes in your system. This is just a number of files. If you want to use this configuration you have to install all needed apt packages and vim plugins manually one by one. They are listed in comments in the files.
